# Workshop Recording: An Introduction to Programming for Absolute Beginners Using Python Pt. 1 (March 2025)

This page provides a video recording of the first part of an introductory workshop series on Python.

**Workshop Description:**

* **What**: This hands\-on workshop will introduce you to the basic concepts of one of the world's most popular programming languages, [Python](https://www.python.org/)! This introduction to Python will include concepts such as data types, variables, operators, if statements, and loops (don’t worry if these terms are unfamiliar; they will be explained in the workshop).
* **Why**: Interested in learning to program but don't know where to start? This workshop will help you establish a foundation to start exploring Python and get rid of any nervousness you might have about learning to code. Learning coding skills will help you automate repetitive tasks; clean, analyze, and visualize large data sets programmatically; and make you stand out in the job market.
* **Software**: Python is free to use. We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (also free to use) for the session, which is a browser\-based programming environment, so no software setup is required.
* **Who**: This workshop is designed for absolute beginners with no previous experience with programming. Skills gained can help participants from any discipline: Humanities, Social Sciences, or Sciences.
